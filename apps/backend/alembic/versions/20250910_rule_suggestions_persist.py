Revision ID: 20250910_rule_suggestions
Revises: 20250910_add_budgets_table
Create Date: 2025-09-10

NOTE:
    This migration is intentionally a no-op placeholder to keep the revision
    chain consistent while persisted suggestions are implemented in-memory.
    The actual tables may be introduced in a future migration without breaking
    the API surface.
