[pytest]

# Root-level pytest configuration. We explicitly scope collection to the backend
# service to avoid descending into the embedded virtualenv (apps/backend/.venv)
# whose third-party packages ship their own test suites (previously producing
# >100 collection errors when running from repo root).

# Limit discovery to the backend application directory so only project tests run.
# Only collect our project's backend test suite (avoid traversing into the embedded
# virtual environment at apps/backend/.venv and third-party library test suites).
testpaths = apps/backend/tests

# Ensure the backend directory (which contains the "app" package) is on sys.path
# when tests are invoked from the repository root.
pythonpath = apps/backend

# Prevent recursion into virtual environments, node modules, build artifacts, etc.
norecursedirs = .* build dist node_modules .git .tox .venv venv */.venv apps/backend/.venv

# Align with backend-specific strictness & import behavior.
